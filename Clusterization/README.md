The folder contains a script which visualize data of Mass spectrometric analysis of Blood plasma proteins on different surfaces.
It is visualized in a way of bulding of heat map. Clusterization apllied further. Also a pair of bar plots added.
The main idea is to distinguish the most abundant proteins over all surfaces, taking into account its equality of intensity from surface to surface.
Comparison bar plots allow to distinguish the difference of abundance of specific proteins from surface to surface.
